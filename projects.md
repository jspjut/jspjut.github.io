My hobbies include music, composition, reading, writing, gaming, and game design. If I ever get
enough time, I'll spend some of it trying out new ways to design games
and explore interactive computing entertainment. Here are a couple
things I've done.

## Wizard Fight Race 7II
Starting at 9:30 am on March 15, 2012, for about 72 hours, I led a
small group of 4 total contributors in creating a simple arcade-style
hack-and-slash game using the Unity3D game engine. You can 
[read about the project](https://sites.google.com/site/72hourgame), 
[download the game](https://sites.google.com/site/72hourgame/download), or even
[play it using a web plugin](/games/WFR7II_Web/WFR7II_Web.html).

## PyGauntlet
As part of a group project as an undergrad we designed a game very
similar to the hack and slash game Gauntlet. I released the source
code on google code and continue to work on it from time to time. It
can be found [on github](https://github.com/jspjut/pygauntlet).
I developed the OpenGL rendering front end on my own after the initial
project was finished.
