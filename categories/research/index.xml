      <description>Today I submitted a technical report done by my students over the last academic year. It took a while to get the write-up to the level of quality that I felt good about submitting it, but now that it&amp;rsquo;s there, I figured I should push it out. I used arXiv to post it since they make it easy to publish a technical report while not preventing you from submitting the work to another venue such as a conference or journal at a later date.</description>

      <description>Over the last year, I advised 5 undergraduate students on a couple research projects. One of them included the development of tutorials and lab assignments for a new class, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have a goal of publishing an academic paper. This student did a good job, and added on a persistance of vision display to a combat robot&amp;rsquo;s spinning arm that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise been there.
The other main project involved the rest of my research students.</description>
