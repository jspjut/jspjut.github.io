      <title>Submitting my first article to arXiv</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I submitted a technical report done by my students over the last academic year.
It took a while to get the write-up to the level of quality that I felt good about submitting it,
but now that it&amp;rsquo;s there, I figured I should push it out.
I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; to post it since they make it easy to publish a technical report
while not preventing you from submitting the work to another venue such as a conference or journal
at a later date.
I used Latex to write the paper, and in preparing the submission, there were a
couple modifications I had to make to get it accepted by the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had to include a line that says &lt;code&gt;\pdfoutput=1&lt;/code&gt; somewhere
in the first 5 lines of the main tex file I submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I had to include the &lt;code&gt;main.bbl&lt;/code&gt; file that was generated
locally as part of my build process.
It appears that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually need the &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file and
only care about the &lt;code&gt;.bbl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my particular document used a style sheet called &lt;code&gt;jpaper.cls&lt;/code&gt; that
had a strange error with how it includes the &lt;code&gt;hyperref&lt;/code&gt; package.
The relevant lines that I had to comment out are below (comments added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;% Link and URL formatting.
%\iftoggle{jp@hyperref}{
%  \RequirePackage{hyperref}
%  \hypersetup{
%    unicode=true,
%    pdfstartview={FitH},
%    colorlinks=true,
%    %citecolor=black,
%    %filecolor=black,
%    %linkcolor=black,
%    %urlcolor=black
% }}{}
%\RequirePackage{url}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had an issue with figures I included that I think had to do with how
I uploaded all of the source material.
Since I submitted each file separately instead of part of a compressed folder,
the graphics I was trying to include were now a part of the root directory instead
of being present in the &lt;code&gt;graphics&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory that I use locally.
Luckily, there was a straightforward fix that I think I&amp;rsquo;ll include in my future
documents by default because it&amp;rsquo;s much cleaner than what I&amp;rsquo;ve done traditionally.
In the main &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file include a line like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;% graphics path
\graphicspath{ {./graphics/} }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, instead of including the relative path to everything in the graphics path,
just include the graphics directly as in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{PairedCaches}
\caption{Partly shared instruction caches}
\label{fig:paired}
\end{figure}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Undergraduate Research</title>
      <link>http://josef.spjut.me/research/2013/09/19/undergraduated-research/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I advised 5 undergraduate students on a couple
research projects. One of them included the development of tutorials
and lab assignments for a new class, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have a goal of
publishing an academic paper. This student did a good job, and added
on a persistance of vision display to a combat robot&amp;rsquo;s spinning arm
that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other main project involved the rest of my research students.
Three of those students were seniors, and have since graduated and
began working full-time jobs in industry.
However, the research they performed was very good, and we are
currently working on an academic paper that I believe to represent a
significant contribution to the field of cache performance analysis.
In fact one of these former students believes that our methods may be
useful to his current employer where he&amp;rsquo;s involved in a dram caching
layer for a large database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real difficulty I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered in finishing off this paper comes
from the lack of availability from the authors, and the lack of
accountability to me for performing work.
The project took some time to get started last fall, and as a result
we only finished about half of what I had planned for the year.
It seems that student pay is a poor motivator for students that will
be making significantly more based on their course grades.
The students I had doing research for grades seemed much more likely
to try to do what I asked, though one had some serious problems
describing what was missing from that student&amp;rsquo;s knowledge.
The end result was that I could not advise this student effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after all of the challenges, the goal is to submit the paper in
the next week. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s not even close to complete. Here&amp;rsquo;s
hoping that the (former) students can find the time to complete the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;
