      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently added a network storage device to my home network and
decided I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to keep reconnecting to the device every
time I got home and wanted to use it.
I did a little searching and found a tool called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.controlplaneapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ControlPlane&lt;/a&gt; that seems ideally
suited to solve my issue.
ControlPlane is really a tool to detect where you are using things
that are already available and allow for automated actions to be taken
when you arrive or leave a place.
The particular action that interested me was mounting my network
storage device, but there are many other actions you can take, such as
opening a web page, or even starting a Time Machine backup.
Things like network SSIDs, time of day, light level and geographic
location can be used to try to detect which location you are at.&lt;/p&gt;
