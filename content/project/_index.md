#Project Ideas

1. Update ncaaf rankings
    * Use API: [sportradar](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/indexFootball.html?python#boxscore)
    * Could reuse old graph analysis
    * Could run monte-carlo simulations based on box score
2. Simple IO Game
    * A giant "match-3" game board
    * Robo-rally
    * "tag" or "freeze tag"
