I happened across [jekyll-bootstrap][] the other day, and I decided I
should move my website to [github.io](http://github.io) after seeing
what [jekyll][] can do.
Among my favorite features are the ability to use markdown for web
pages, which allows a reasonably good citation syntax for adding links
to my co-authors.
As an example, the following is the syntax for one paper along with
the citations to my co-authors:

   [jekyllbootstrap]: http://jekyllbootstrap.com
   [jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com

    1. [Daniel Kopta][dk], **[Josef Spjut][jbs]**, [Erik Brunvand][elb];
    **Grid-Based Ray Tracing for a Parallel Computing Architecture**,
    *High Performance Graphics (HPG'09)*, New Orleans, August 1-3, 2009.
       [dk]: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~dkopta
       [ks]: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kshkurko
       [jbs]: http://www3.hmc.edu/~jspjut
       [elb]: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb

The beauty of this is I now only need to update one spot if anyone
changes their affiliation or home page. Awesome.

Conveniently, jekyll-bootstrap also gives all the niceness of [twitter
bootstrap][], such as the decent template you now see (I hope to improve
it to my liking more in the future).
The main reason I chose the hooligan template is that it came with
easy-to-use social media integration that you can see in the top right
if you are looking at this webpage on a non-mobile browser.

As an added benefit, I can now easily post blog entries, and hook into
Disqus for comments. Nice.
