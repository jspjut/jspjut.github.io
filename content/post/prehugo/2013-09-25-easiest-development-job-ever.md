Today I came across [a blog
post](http://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html) from a developer
who describes a project he worked on that failed spectacularly.
This project was a web database query to sort real estate brokers for
an insurance company.
If you want to see the results of the project in the way the original
author intended, then you should visit the link above.
It turns out that the insurance company provides the contact info of
real estate brokers solely to collect a referral fee for that
service. 
The database query in effect bypassed the referral procedure so that
clients would be able to locate brokers without the company collecting
a fee.
In the end, all of the information from the database was removed so
that the user was just given a list of names, each with the referral
number for the company's referral hotline which would allow the
company to collect the referral fee.
If this developer had figured out what the company actually wanted at
the beginning, then it would have been easy for him to just place the
phone number on the website and call it a day.
