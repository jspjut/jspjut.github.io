Today, [NVIDIA announced](http://gearnuke.com/nvidia-announces-gameworks-program-montreal-2013-supports-steamos/)
a new program to help game developers
effectively use NVIDIA hardware called GameWorks.
The thing that excites me the most about GameWorks is the inclusion of
[Optix](http://www.nvidia.com/object/optix.html) in a program that
directly targets game developers.
Optix is a ray tracing environment developed by people I know from my
studies at Utah that has previously been used to help develop
rendering engines for design and production environments.
This recent announcement means that the important global illumination
features that work more naturally in ray tracing will be more readily
available for game developers.
I expect it will still be a couple of years before any top games are
released using ray tracing in the real time rendering engine, but this
represents a clear step in the right direction.

Also today, [NVIDIA announced game bundles](http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/10/17/twimtbp/) 
and $50-$100 discounts to the SHIELD handheld game system for people
who also purchase a Geforce GTX graphics card.
Finally, a new technology called
[G-SYNC](http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/10/18/g-sync/) was
announced that allows the GPU to refresh the monitor at a variable
refresh rate, more closely tying the visuals coming from your display
to the underlying game engine.
Oh, and one more interesting note, NVIDIA also expressed direct
interest in supporting SteamOS when it launches, indicating that Linux
graphics drivers should continue to be a priority for the company.
