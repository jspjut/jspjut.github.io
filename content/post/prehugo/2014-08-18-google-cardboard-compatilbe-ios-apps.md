I got a [Google Cardboard](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/)
last week at
[SIGGRAPH](http://www.siggraph.org/) and since I don't own
an Android phone, I set out to find a way to use my iPhone to try it
out. 
The first thing I noticed is that there were no web pages easily found
that mentioned a list of apps that are compatible with it, even
without including the magnetic switch for input.
What follows is a short list of apps I discovered on my search:

* [DI 360](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/di-360/id893235638?mt=8) lets you replay a 3d video captured while tracking your head
  movements so you can experience whatever part of the video you want
  just by looking around. You have to press a button on the touchscreen
  to switch it to VR mode, but it's an interesting experience once you
  do.
* [ZOMBIE dive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dive-zombie/id903661452?mt=8) is a simple empty world where zombies come at you from
  random directions and you have to shoot them. The shotgun is on
  autofire so you just have to look at the zombies to keep them from
  getting you.
* [Refugio3D](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/refugio3d-spacestation/id827207586?mt=8) is a virtual walk through of a couple interesting places,
  including a spaceship interior. It allows walking forward by looking
  down to toggle walking or standing still.
    * Also on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Refugio3D.SpaceStation&hl=en)

After I found these, I CBS News posted [an
article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-cardboard-works-on-the-iphone-too/)
listing a few more options, but I have yet to try them. 
There may even be some overlap between our lists.

In case you want to buy one, [DODO Case is selling them for about
$25](http://www.dodocase.com/products/google-cardboard-vr-goggle-toolkit).
