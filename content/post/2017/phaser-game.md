In the past few weeks, I decided to spend some of my spare time trying out some new methods for game development.
In particular, I thought it would be good to come up with something that would allow me to easily create a networked game for multiple players, and would give me a chance to learn something new.
I decided to look into javascript frameworks, and there were a wide variety out there. 
This post will focus on some of my first thoughts on [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), which I've been trying out somewhat. 
I'm actually using [phaser ce](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce), but that's beside the point.
There are tons of tutorials out there, but the one I went through was the first part of [Jason Yang's Multiplayer Game Tutorial](http://gojasonyang.com/post/phaserMultiplayerGamePart1.html).
