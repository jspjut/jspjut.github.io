I recently undertook the effort of moving my website from jekyll using jekyll-bootstrap to Hugo and I wanted to record some notes from my efforts. In particular I want to collect a set of useful links that helped me in making the switch.

For what it's worth, I greatly prefer Hugo now that I've gotten used to it, though there wasn't too much broken about Jekyll.

The most useful thing for developing my site was when I found the [academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). It turns out that in Hugo, themes contain a lot of the functionality of a site, and they make it easy to add on functionality either by modifying the theme, or your site in particular. The academic theme is widely used so there a good [reference page](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/post/getting-started/) to help you get started.

The creator of the academic theme also has a [good tutorial](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) on his blog for how to set up a new hugo site from scratch.
