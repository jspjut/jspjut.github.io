# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "As augmented reality (AR) moves from prototype to product, we need to begin thinking about how we can integrate AR into our daily lives. If done poorly, AR has the potential to bring severe distraction and removal from the real world alongside the many potential benefits. I will present a few early prototype applications designed to reduce distraction, including AR for wayfinding, augmented online shopping, and ideas for annotating the world around us."
