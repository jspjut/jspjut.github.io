title = "Improving Temporal Anti-aliasing with Adaptive Ray Tracing"
# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Based on a High Performance Graphics paper and Ray Tracing Gems chapter, we present a pragmatic approach to real-time supersampling that extends commonly used temporal atialiasing techniques with adaptive ray tracing. This algorithm conforms to the constraints of a commercial game engine, removes blurring and ghosting artifacts associated with standard temporal antialiasing, and achieves quality approaching 16x supersampling of geometry, shading, and materials within the 16 ms frame budget required for most games."
