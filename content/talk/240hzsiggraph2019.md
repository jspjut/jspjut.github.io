title = "Ray Tracing at 240 Hz"
# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Based on a recent High Performance Graphics paper, we present a technique for real-time ray tracing with the goal of reaching 240 frames per second or more. The core idea is to trade spatial resolution for faster temporal updates in such a way that the display and human visual system cooperate to integrate high-quality images. We use a combination of frameless and interleaved rendering concepts together with ideas from temporal antialiasing algorithms and novel building blocksâ€”the major one being adaptive selection of pixel orderings within tiles, which reduces spatiotemporal aliasing significantly. The image quality is verified with a user study. Our work can be used for esports or any kind of rendering where higher frame rates are needed."
