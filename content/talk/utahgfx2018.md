# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "As augmented reality (AR) moves from prototype to product, AR will begin to integrate into our daily lives. If done poorly, AR has the potential to bring severe distraction and removal from the real world alongside the many potential benefits. NVIDIA, the global leader in computer graphics, does research on computer graphics in general. More recently, we explore a few early prototype AR applications designed to reduce distraction, including AR for wayfinding, augmented online shopping, and ideas for annotating the world around us."
