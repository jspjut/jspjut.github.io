I've often wanted to be able to make animated gifs of things. 
I have also been interested in simple programmatic video editing from
time to time, particularly for animating a series of still frames from
images rendered by my graphics architecture simulations.
Today on reddit, I came across [this blog
post](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/making-animated-gifs-from-video-files-with-python/)
that describes a sequence of ways to use the
[MoviePy](http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) library to generate
animated gifs. 
It looks like exactly the kind of solution I want since I like to use
python whenever possible for simple things.
I don't have anything profound to say about this, and mostly just
wanted to record the links for my future reference.
