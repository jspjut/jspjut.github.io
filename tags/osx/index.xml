      <description>I recently added a network storage device to my home network and decided I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to keep reconnecting to the device every time I got home and wanted to use it. I did a little searching and found a tool called ControlPlane that seems ideally suited to solve my issue. ControlPlane is really a tool to detect where you are using things that are already available and allow for automated actions to be taken when you arrive or leave a place.</description>
