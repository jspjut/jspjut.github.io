      <title>Submitting my first article to arXiv</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I submitted a technical report done by my students over the last academic year.
It took a while to get the write-up to the level of quality that I felt good about submitting it,
but now that it&amp;rsquo;s there, I figured I should push it out.
I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; to post it since they make it easy to publish a technical report
while not preventing you from submitting the work to another venue such as a conference or journal
at a later date.
I used Latex to write the paper, and in preparing the submission, there were a
couple modifications I had to make to get it accepted by the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had to include a line that says &lt;code&gt;\pdfoutput=1&lt;/code&gt; somewhere
in the first 5 lines of the main tex file I submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I had to include the &lt;code&gt;main.bbl&lt;/code&gt; file that was generated
locally as part of my build process.
It appears that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually need the &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file and
only care about the &lt;code&gt;.bbl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my particular document used a style sheet called &lt;code&gt;jpaper.cls&lt;/code&gt; that
had a strange error with how it includes the &lt;code&gt;hyperref&lt;/code&gt; package.
The relevant lines that I had to comment out are below (comments added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;% Link and URL formatting.
%\iftoggle{jp@hyperref}{
%  \RequirePackage{hyperref}
%  \hypersetup{
%    unicode=true,
%    pdfstartview={FitH},
%    colorlinks=true,
%    %citecolor=black,
%    %filecolor=black,
%    %linkcolor=black,
%    %urlcolor=black
% }}{}
%\RequirePackage{url}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had an issue with figures I included that I think had to do with how
I uploaded all of the source material.
Since I submitted each file separately instead of part of a compressed folder,
the graphics I was trying to include were now a part of the root directory instead
of being present in the &lt;code&gt;graphics&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory that I use locally.
Luckily, there was a straightforward fix that I think I&amp;rsquo;ll include in my future
documents by default because it&amp;rsquo;s much cleaner than what I&amp;rsquo;ve done traditionally.
In the main &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file include a line like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;% graphics path
\graphicspath{ {./graphics/} }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, instead of including the relative path to everything in the graphics path,
just include the graphics directly as in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{PairedCaches}
\caption{Partly shared instruction caches}
\label{fig:paired}
\end{figure}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Multiple Author Affiliations in LaTeX</title>
      <link>http://josef.spjut.me/latex/2014/01/03/multiple-author-affiliations-in-latex/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://josef.spjut.me/latex/2014/01/03/multiple-author-affiliations-in-latex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently had the pleasure of updating a recent journal article
submission with my list of affiliations.
On the article, there are 5 authors, and among them, I am the only one
with different affiliations, though I share the other affiliation with
the rest of the authors.
After some quick googling on how I should perform this, I came up with
the following snippet of code that should have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\usepackage{authblk}

\author[1]{Daniel Kopta}
\author[1]{Konstantin Shkurko}
\author[1,2,3]{Josef Spjut}
\author[1]{Erik Brunvand}
\author[1]{Al Davis}
\affil[1]{School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\\
       \{redacted\}@email.edu}
\affil[2]{NVIDIA Research}
\affil[3]{Department of Engineering, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA}
\renewcommand\Authands{ and }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;authblk&lt;/code&gt; package seems to be beautiful for performing this
function, however it has one problem when used with the other styles
for this particular article. It causes &lt;code&gt;\maketitle&lt;/code&gt; to fail
complaining about some spacing error, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to
fix it.
Instead, I opted for the poor man&amp;rsquo;s solution to the problem with the
following set of lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\author[D. Kopta et al.]
       {D. Kopta$^1$, K. Shkurko$^1$, J. Spjut$^{1,2,3}$,
       E. Brunvand$^1$, and A. Davis$^1$
       \\
       $^1$School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City,
       UT, USA\\
       \{redacted\}@email.edu\\ 
       $^2$NVIDIA Research\\
       $^3$Department of Engineering, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont,
       CA, USA\\
       }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code generates into the following on the pdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://josef.spjut.me/blog/images/2014/01/authors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Author Affiliations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not as graceful as the &lt;code&gt;authblk&lt;/code&gt; code, but it works and it&amp;rsquo;s a
simple hack that you only have to do once per article.&lt;/p&gt;
