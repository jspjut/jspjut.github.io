      <description>Today I had the fortunate presence of mind to record videos for a couple of my students&amp;rsquo; lab projects that I found particularly interesting. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and embed these videos for anyone interested in watching them. To explain briefly, the assignment was to use assembly programming for the PIC 32 microcontroller to have a speaker produce a song. Optionally, students were allowed to play a song of their choosing after putting that song in the program memory.</description>

      <description>This week I met with each of the students in my MicroPs class and discussed their lab assignment. The first lab assignment was primarily soldering components onto their PCB and verifying that all of the components worked. As part of these lab interviews, I get to ask each student a question about their project to try to test their knowledge. One thing I noticed is that many of the students didn&amp;rsquo;t own their project as fully as I would like.</description>
