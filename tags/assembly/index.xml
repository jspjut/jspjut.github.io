      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had the fortunate presence of mind to record videos for a
couple of my students&amp;rsquo; lab projects that I found particularly
interesting.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and embed these videos for anyone
interested in watching them.
To explain briefly, the assignment was to use assembly programming for
the PIC 32 microcontroller to have a speaker produce a song.
Optionally, students were allowed to play a song of their choosing
after putting that song in the program memory.
The following are two of these custom songs chosen by the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is the video inspiring the tagline, &amp;ldquo;A Whole New World&amp;rdquo; which
is impressive because these two students created a duet from their
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/YtRUuayHCLg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allowfullscreen=&#34;1&#34;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally another student recreated a famous internet song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/XZ6qLQ16RqQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allowfullscreen=&#34;1&#34;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last personal note: 10 years ago today I flew home from spending 2
years in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
