      <description>Today I had the fortunate presence of mind to record videos for a couple of my students&amp;rsquo; lab projects that I found particularly interesting. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and embed these videos for anyone interested in watching them. To explain briefly, the assignment was to use assembly programming for the PIC 32 microcontroller to have a speaker produce a song. Optionally, students were allowed to play a song of their choosing after putting that song in the program memory.</description>
