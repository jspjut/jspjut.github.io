      <description>This semester has been extremely exciting. In particular, E85 has been updated from MIPS to use the ARM v7 instructions set. This has been a good experience for me despite some difficulties and a few moments of intensity where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure things would come together in time. In doing this, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn a lot about the ARM ISA, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I like it a lot. In particular, I think it strikes a reasonably good balance between RISC and CISC instructions where there are a couple nice addressing modes for stack manipulation that aren&amp;rsquo;t quite RISC, but are close enough.</description>
