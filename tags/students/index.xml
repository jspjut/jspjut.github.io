      <description>This semester I am teaching a project-based class that has almost no formal instruction by the professor. Instead of providing close direction, I am attempting to give the students more autonomy and control over their learning and the things they will get out of the class. This presents a number of difficulties, and I plan to discuss them as the semester proceeds. Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to say something about student-run class sessions, which will happen for the first time in my class next week.</description>
