      <description>In the past few weeks, I decided to spend some of my spare time trying out some new methods for game development. In particular, I thought it would be good to come up with something that would allow me to easily create a networked game for multiple players, and would give me a chance to learn something new. I decided to look into javascript frameworks, and there were a wide variety out there.</description>

      <description>For my other blog post today, I decided I wanted to embed the youtube videos I recorded earlier. Since the rest of my website is fully responsive now, I thought it would be best to find a way to allow embedded videos to also be responsive to the browser window. This is one of the main reasons I started using bootstrap in the first place, and jekyllbootstrap for my website. Luckily I came across the excellent post Todd Motto made posting his fluidvids.</description>
