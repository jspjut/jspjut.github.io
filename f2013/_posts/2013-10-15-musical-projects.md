Today I had the fortunate presence of mind to record videos for a
couple of my students' lab projects that I found particularly
interesting. 
In this post I'll go ahead and embed these videos for anyone
interested in watching them.
To explain briefly, the assignment was to use assembly programming for
the PIC 32 microcontroller to have a speaker produce a song.
Optionally, students were allowed to play a song of their choosing
after putting that song in the program memory.
The following are two of these custom songs chosen by the students.

First up is the video inspiring the tagline, "A Whole New World" which
is impressive because these two students created a duet from their
projects.

Finally another student recreated a famous internet song.

One last personal note: 10 years ago today I flew home from spending 2
years in Spain.
