      <description>This list of top 50 teams in the country is based on a simple script I wrote to analyze the strength of schedule of each team based on the win/loss record of their opponents. This should remove all of the bias inherent in the electoral voting systems and appropriately reward wins against strong opponents. This data was gathered from the ESPN standings on October 30, 2014 at 07:08:17 Pacific.</description>
