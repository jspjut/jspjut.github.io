      <title>Gaming Toxicity for Developers</title>
      <link>http://josef.spjut.me/post/2019/gaming-toxicity-for-devs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 22:00:24 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Toxicity is a huge problem in online video games. Some of the most well-known toxic online gaming communities include League of Legends, Dota and your favorite console shooters. While console shooters have generally included voice chat and a range of &amp;ldquo;your mom&amp;rdquo; insults screamed by the 13 year olds on the other end of the line, PC games typically include text chat, and a clearly visible record of every toxic statement. I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus my remarks at this time on the text-based medium, even though clearly voice chat and vocal insults are a huge part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of a 2 part series on toxicity. You can find &lt;a href=&#34;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;part 2 here&lt;/a&gt; (when finished).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;systems-for-dealing-with-toxicity&#34;&gt;Systems for Dealing with Toxicity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago when I still played League of Legends, they introduced &lt;a href=&#34;http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tribunal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, which was given as their solution to toxicity among the player base. The basic idea is that players are given the ability to report others when they see bad behavior in game. Then a small group of volunteer players are given a chance to review the text logs (and some in-game events) to see if these reports justify action or not. The theory was that a group of your peers would be able to effectively determine when you have violated the implicity standards of good sportsmanship and behavior. The Tribunal had a good run, but was eventually discontinued in 2014. I suspect that part of the problem with the system was that Riot had to incentivize participation by providing rewards to those who vote in the tribunal, and the rewards were tied to achieving consensus, which led to nearly all participants always voting to confirm toxicity, even when there was none present. They&amp;rsquo;ve since replaced the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen applied in many games from Puzzle Pirates to Overwatch is to automatically replace certain &amp;ldquo;bad words&amp;rdquo; with other more innocuous statements. I mentioned Puzzle Pirates because they &lt;a href=&#34;https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/List_of_known_filtered_words&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;did a particularly interesting thing&lt;/a&gt; where they replaced common swear words from modern English with things that sound piratey. It was extremely common to see people say, &amp;ldquo;billions of blue blistering barnacles&amp;rdquo;, but that was just a replacement for another exclamation. More recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Text_Chat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Overwatch replaced &amp;ldquo;gg ez&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with a range of phrases meant to soften the blow. It&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a running joke among players to send &amp;ldquo;gg ez&amp;rdquo; now to see what phrases they end up getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rising interest of the computing world on artificial intelligence(AI), there are many looking into ways to use AI to help police or reduce toxicity in online interaction. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perspectiveapi.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Perspective API&lt;/a&gt; is one such company that provides AI-driven tools to identify how toxic a particular phrase might be. These emerging technologies may be extremely useful in helping developers and players improve the experience of interacting with others online. Of course while these tools can help reduce negative experiences, if misused, they could lead us to an extremely controlled authoritarian online experience and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;censorship-ethics&#34;&gt;Censorship Ethics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying, but just to be sure, this blog post is my own words and does not necessarily represent the position of my employers, my family or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that freedom of expression is an important human right that should be granted to all people. Only in extreme circumstances should that basic human right of freedom of expression be restricted. Today most people in the west believe in freedom of speech, and the only disagreement tends to come when determining which circumstances are worthy of restricting the otherwise free speech. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best here to take no position on which things should be restricted and instead focus on an approach that I believe to be fair to everyone, and should avoid putting game developers and content owners in a position of explicitly deciding what to censor. This approach is accomplished in 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can say whatever they want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can ignore whatever they don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, people should be able to say whatever they want. Let them type messages and hit send. As long as those messages aren&amp;rsquo;t causing arbitrary code to be executed on your server, or represent some automated attack, they can be fairly treated and given the same chance to arrive at the server prior to distribution to others in the game. Perhaps even more importantly, those messages should be shown on the screen of the sender to confirm that they were able to send the message. It&amp;rsquo;s okay if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up until after a server round trip, and in fact, that is sort of good because it lets the user know when the server has had a chance to distribute the message. I often use that feature to test if I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LinpRhB4aWU&amp;amp;t=21&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;network connectivity problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, people should be able to opt out of hearing what they don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear. This is where the more exotic tools can be used, and even many of the traditional tools. Game developers can provide a set of filters that allow players to opt out of seeing certain words, or even just replace those words with more friendly alternatives. Players should be able to explicitly mute others who they believe to be offensive, or even just uninteresting. It&amp;rsquo;s also okay to identify groups of people who demonstrate certain kinds of behavior (harsh sarcasm for instance), and allow players to opt in or opt out of communicating with those people as a group. The truth is that your players are smart, and they know what they don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear or what they can&amp;rsquo;t bear, and should be able to make these decisions on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible way to use AI-based toxicity detection would be to find chat messages that player A enters, and when they reach a higher level of toxicity, recommend that they opt out of certain incoming communications that might be triggering this bad behavior. That way, they get an easy way to reduce their internal negative emotions, but aren&amp;rsquo;t forced into it. Maybe things that are being viewed by the system as toxic are actually old friends joking about something from their childhood, and that context may be lost in the medium. It would truly be a travesty if we lose out on the richness of human interaction just because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust our players enough. Give the power to the players!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-not-to-do&#34;&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; to Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game developers and publishers hold a lot of power in their hands. They build platforms that are used by large numbers of users, and develop into large, vibrant communities. Of particular note are the large number of young adults that find a home in these communities. As an example, in the last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fortnite.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; has become the home to a huge number of players and has permeated popular discourse. Developers need to be mindful of the public perception of their platform, and make visible steps to improve the situation if things are going poorly, particularly with respect to toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be quite easy to overstep your bounds as a game developer, and take too much control over what your players are able to do. Obviously if there are clear game design or plot reasons for communication restrictions, I consider that a part of the art, and believe they are totally appropriate. A good example of doing this right is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;, which happens to be one of my favorite games. In it, you are matched at random with other players on the same level as you, but you cannot communicate except through occasional pings with an audio and visual cue. This fits in quite naturally with the rest of the game&amp;rsquo;s story, and lets you work around the restriction to effectively collaborate on solving the puzzles before you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I&amp;rsquo;m most worried about is a situation where developers think that the only way to deal with bad behavior is to punish offenders. Obviously there&amp;rsquo;s some room for sticks (in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;carrot/stick paradigm&lt;/a&gt; ), but I believe they should be used sparingly. If punishments are too harsh, the people being punished have no chance to learn and grow from the experience. I believe that when done right, online games and communities provide excellent opportunities for humans to develop into successful members of society. As a game developer, you&amp;rsquo;re effectively being placed in a position of legal authority over the behavior of your game, but without multiple branches of government to balance out your power. Please keep your use of tools and punishments metered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players bear a large part of the responsibility for good behavior, so stay tuned for &lt;a href=&#34;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my next post&lt;/a&gt; on that part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Console to PC Game Port Requests</title>
      <link>http://josef.spjut.me/post/2019/console-to-pc-port/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 16:51:24 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://josef.spjut.me/post/2019/console-to-pc-port/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the holiday break, I had a chance to play a number of different games. Among these games, I tried out a few PC ports of primarily console-focused games, and I was reminded of some things that frustrate me when I have my &amp;ldquo;PC Gamer&amp;rdquo; hat on. Without calling out any particular developer or publisher, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this change to suggest a few recommendations for PC ports that I wish every developer would follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use the mouse like a joystick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use my default PC resolution on first boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test your (primarily shooter) game with gaming mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an option for unlocked framerate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow 3D render resolution to be set independently from 2D resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow borderless window fullscreen mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mouse-like-a-joystick&#34;&gt;Mouse like a joystick?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my number one complaint with PC ports of console games, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense how anyone releases games with such a terrible user experience any more. The mouse is expected to have a linear mapping from motion on desk to motion in game. I&amp;rsquo;ve played a few games that turn the linear motion into an acceleration or set a velocity of motion with at most a spring constant of damping that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. I understand that I could get out a controller to play the game, and I do appreciate that control scheme at times, but if your game isn&amp;rsquo;t even playable with mouse, just tell me up front and disable the mouse entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sub-point about mouse behavior is that if you allow mouse input in your game on PC, please make the mouse work like a mouse in your menus. A common shortfall here is creating an inventory management system built for controller input and then treating it the same on PC where &amp;ldquo;wasd&amp;rdquo; controls the object selection and only the mouse button (or even worse the spacebar) selects the highlighted item. If I have a mouse, you can expect me to be ready to click on things and to drag and drop inventory items to be where I want them to be. Decades of desktop operating system use has trained nearly all of humanity how this works. Why would you build a game interface in 2019 that throws away things we learned &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in 1968&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;boot-resolution&#34;&gt;Boot resolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this, except it&amp;rsquo;s super irritating to have all of your windows resize themselves because a game decided that on first boot it had to be absolutely sure it would start by setting a fullscreen resolution of 640x480. If you can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to query the OS for the right resolution, could you please at least start in windowed mode to not throw off everything else I have going on my PC? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;gaming-mice&#34;&gt;Gaming mice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one isn&amp;rsquo;t relevant to every type of game, and is primarily related to shooter games and other games that use the mouse to aim. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a lot about mice as input devices for shooter games lately, and hope to write more on that topic soon. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a few games recently which are shooter games. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly mad about the ones that have mouse acceleration turned on by default as long as there&amp;rsquo;s an option to turn it off. But some of these games have had mouse sensitivity settings that are much too high by default, and often won&amp;rsquo;t even go low enough without resorting to editing &lt;code&gt;.ini&lt;/code&gt; files manually. For reference, standard issue mice have a built in DPI setting of 800 but gaming mice default to 2400-3200, which is 3-4x &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than what a normal mouse has. If you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to buy $50 gaming mice for your QA testers, could you at least take your mouse sensitivity range and make sure it goes to values 4x lower than the lowest setting that your testers are comfortable with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;unlock-framerate&#34;&gt;Unlock framerate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is the classic PC gamer complaint, but 30 fps vsync on is extremely frustrating, especially when I just finished playing a few rounds of Overwatch at 240Hz. The difference is jarring. Thankfully most game ports now default to a limit of 60 after some successful complaint campaigns, but you could avoid having problems if you just query the OS for what it thinks the display framerate can go up to, and allow that. Then you won&amp;rsquo;t have to patch your game 5 years from now when everyone is complaining that you don&amp;rsquo;t support 480Hz, or whatever the fps of the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;independent-2d-and-3d-resolution&#34;&gt;Independent 2D and 3D resolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I remember seeing this option was on &lt;a href=&#34;www.champions-online.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Champions Online&lt;/a&gt; and it completely blew my mind. Having looked a bit deeper at how game engines produce their images, it is relatively straightforward to set your text and UI elements to full display resolution while allowing the in-game resolution to scale down (or up) to match the capabilities of the GPU in the system. This gives the user a better experience and allows them to customize based on their situation (laptop gamers especially enjoy these settings!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;borderless-window&#34;&gt;Borderless window&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to do multiple things with my computer. In particular, I really like to be able to stay in contact with my friends. When you launch a fullscreen application in windows, the alt-tab switch to my messenger client of choice (Discord these days) both hides your game, and takes entirely too long to switch to and from. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fullscreen application and I end up involved in a discussion about when and where our next group meetup is going to happen, I may never return, either because I forget you&amp;rsquo;re there in the background or because I get too frustrated to keep going back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a variety of research projects that I&amp;rsquo;d retrospectively say were all related to the future of augmented reality, and particularly head mounted displays for augmented reality. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started shifting my research focus to a new area, so I figured this would be a good time to post a retrospective of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and what I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over these last 3 years. Obviously that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of time to compress in a single blog post, so it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say this is going to be very brief in comparison to the level of depth of the work and effort. Since this is 3 years of time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the number 3 heavily here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-things-i-ve-tried&#34;&gt;Three things I&amp;rsquo;ve tried&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At NVIDIA, we&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with HMDs, GPU-based rendering for them, and evolving the interface between GPUs and displays. Here are a few projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on that are firmly in that space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwpqSupFRnw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Binary refreshing OLED for reduced latency&lt;/a&gt; (and 1700Hz+ framerate!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_Varifocal-Virtuality%3A-A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Varifocal virtuality&lt;/a&gt;: codesigned display optics and computational blur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foveated displays - not yet published!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-collaborations&#34;&gt;Three collaborations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with others, I wanted to draw attention to the great work Rob Shepherd and his &lt;a href=&#34;https://orl.mae.cornell.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Organic Robotics Lab&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University have been doing. All of these represent work at the interface between the human&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
